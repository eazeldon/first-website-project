                                    <strong><mark>Bob - Lead Guitarist</mark></strong>
                                    
                                    Bob started his career in Manchester, U.K. where he played for a number of different bands in the 60's.
                                    He later did several studio sessions in the USA. 
                                    <strong>Bob is especially known for his stint with Joe Cocker</strong>, with whom he toured the World during the 80's and early 90's.
                                    In the mid 90's Bob joined Red Smoke after a jam session with Jack at the Baked Potato in LA.
                                    
                                    <strong><mark>Sarah - Back-up Vocals</mark></strong>
                                    
                                    Sarah has made a name for herself in the California Studio scene, where she has appeared on over 40 songs making the Top 10 charts in the USA and U.K.
                                   Sarah is best known for having appeared on all of Toto's albums to date. She also joined Toto for 4 World Tours.
                                    She still works the US Studio scene when not working with Red Smoke.
                                    Sarah joined Red Smoke after having been called in to replace a back-up singer that fell ill during a concert in LA back in 2001.
                                    
                                     <strong><mark>James - Drummer</mark></strong>
                                    
                                    <strong>James learnt to play the Drums with Phil Collins in the early 70's</strong> when his family lived next door to Phil.
                                    James has toured the world with James Taylor and Jazz/Fusion greats Mike Stern and Steps a Head.
                                    He always loved the 60's music and joined Red Smoke in 2002.
                                    
                                     <strong><mark>Jack - Bass</mark></strong>
                                    
                                    Jack started Red Smoke back in 1969 and composed all of the Band's early material. He is the sole original band member left.
                                    His entire career has been devoted to Red Smoke, but he has made guest appearances both on Albums and Tours with the Rolling Stones and Elton John.
                                    Jack is still heavily involved in composing together with Francine and also writes material for other artists.
                                    <strong>Jack has won 3 Grammy Awards</strong> for his work with Red Smoke.
                                    
                                    <strong><mark> Francine - Lead Vocals</mark></strong>
                                    
                                    Francine is the newest band member and joined in 2010.
                                    Jack saw Francine do a cover on one of Red Smoke's hits and immediately knew he had found the new lead singer for Red Smoke.
                                    Francine has a past as a background singer and studio singer as well as in composing material for other artists.
                                    Francine has written songs for Christina Aguilera, John Mayer, Brand New Heavies and Creed. She has won <strong>2 Grammy Awards</strong> with Creed.
                                    Having always loved and been inspired by the music from the 60's Francine couldn't resist the offer to join Red Smoke as the new lead singer.
                                    Francine has written and co-written several of Red Smokes newest songs.
