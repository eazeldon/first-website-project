# Milestone web-project-1 

This is my very first web site and my first milestone project during
my studies at the Code Institute. https://eazeldon.github.io/first-website-project/

## Concept

This is a website for a 60's rock/pop music band.
The idea is to showcase some of their work as well as market upcoming shows
and inform of what shows you can contract them to.

Moreover, the site aims to share some information about the band members and
their roles in the band.

The target group for the site are avid fans, with special focus on their core
group of fans, which are women.

The design ideas is to be inviting and soothing.

## Features & Technology

These are the features and technologies that I applied on the site

### Video-clips
  I created the music and rotating images, the problem is the images l got
form google.com are not high resolotion,l edited the video in quick time and
adobe photoshop.

### Image layout
  I created and edited the background image in adobe photoshop.
  All other images have been edited in photoshop as well to make them fit for
  purpose.
  
### Music
  I choose this music video, because its remind me of high-fashion and
the glamorous days of the 60's. Edits are made in quick time and adobe 
photoshop.

### Example code from user centric
I combined code from the Rosie video example and the Whiskey drop video example.

### Colors
  I choose the colors, it remind me of a lipstick palette and blush on make-up.
I expect it to be especially appealing to women.   

## Testing notes
I've tested the website in Chrome and Safari as well as the screen sizes in Cloud 9. All pages and all multimedia content worked well but there were some discrepancies in how the headings on the music page. I have worked on making it look ok in as many screen sizes as possible as well as on both Chrome and Safari. I have put priority on making the site look good on the cell phone since today it is the first point of contact for most people. There was one issue on the cell phone I have managed to solve - If you are in the Safari browser on Apple iPhone and iPad mini with iOS 12.4 and click the "About & Pictures" on the menu bar it works fine except if you are on the Contact page. If you are on the contact page and click "About & Pictures" it opened the page in a new window - This issue is now resolved. There is one issue remaining on devices running on iOS 12.4 and using the safari browser - When you open the "Music" page the video clips are shown only with a "play" image, not the first frame of the videos. Once you click the play button the frame image appears and stays open. I have not managed to find a solution for this issue. This issue is not present in Chrome or Safari on a lap-top running macOS Mojave 10.14.5..
